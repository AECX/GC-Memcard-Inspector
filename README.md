# GC-Memcard-Inspector
Reads and parses a RAW memory card (GC)
-----------------------------------------------
This Project reads and parses the Header of a given
.raw Memory Card File (Nintendo GameCube)

I aim to create a C# version of Dolphin's Gamecube Manager
one day and this is kind of a beta test thing.

I'll add Dir/Dir Entry parsing once testing is done.
Probably sooner let's see.

You're free to copy, edit and use the code however you want.
Credits to me are appreciated but not necessary.

## MemCard.cs
The main part this Project, will be used for Memory Card Manager
once I carry on developing that.
